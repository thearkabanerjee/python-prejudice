# Scope
# Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is not available outside of that function.

# Example
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
result = subtract(5, 3)
print(x)
# ERROR! "name 'x' is not defined"

#When the subtract function is called, we assign 5 to the variable x, but x 
# only exists in the code within the subtract function. If we try to print x outside of that function,
# then we won't get a result. In fact, we'll get a big fat error.
